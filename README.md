# SensEmBERT

We are now busy with ACL deadline. A better interface will be 
provided right after the 10th of Dicember!

In the meanwhile, in this repository you can find the data for the paper: [SensEmBERT: Context-Enhanced Sense Embeddings for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation](https://pasinit.github.io/papers/scarlini_etal_aaai2020.pdf).

We made available SensEmBERT vectors at [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v-Fwa1m5QOlLNBmRAlL_YCoxV0J7bKXy?usp=sharing).
Therein, you may find the vectors together with a README. The vector files follow  the word2vec format, i.e., 
each line is a vector where elements are separated by space and the first component is a sense and the other components the feature of 
the vectors.
