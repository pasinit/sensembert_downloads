# SensEmBERT

We are now busy with ACL deadline. A better interface will be 
provided right after the 10th of Dicember!

In the meanwhile, in this repository you can find the data for the paper: [SensEmBERT: Context-Enhanced Sense Embeddings for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation](https://pasinit.github.io/papers/scarlini_etal_aaai2020.pdf).

[Vectors Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DV6m4A6LbHpxgk932B7t0qOkdNAHHR7r?usp=sharing)

The package contains two files each in the word2vec format: 
the first line contains two values separated by space containing the size of the vectors and the number of vectors in the file.
each subsequent line, instead, is a vector where elements are separated by space and the first component is the id of the sense and the other components are the features.
